# How to send a simple PS4 notification using the library

Stop! Before doing anything else, please run the "update.sh" file that is located outside of libPS4. <br>
It can be run using this command: `sudo bash update.sh.` <br>

By running this file, you will build libPS4 and set its location as a global environment variable called PS4SDK. <br>
This must be completed before building a payload!
